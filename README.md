The code creates a loop of imgaes, including a local barograph trace, to aid in weather observation. Current observations of temperature and wind from 3 different stations are displayed. The barograph is generated using data from an HP203B sensor connected to a raspberry pi via an I2C bus. Various images and loops are scraped from open source government sites. These images are displayed using matplotlib.
